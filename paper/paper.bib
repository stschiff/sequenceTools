              software tools, and public, community-maintained online archives.

               8,000-3,000 years ago by enriching ancient DNA libraries for a
               target set of almost 400,000 polymorphisms. Enrichment of these
               positions decreases the sequencing required for genome-wide
               ancient DNA analysis by a median of around 250-fold, allowing us
               to study an order of magnitude more individuals than previous
               studies and to obtain new insights about the past. We show that
               the populations of Western and Far Eastern Europe followed
               opposite trajectories between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At the
               beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, $\sim{}$8,000-7,000
               years ago, closely related groups of early farmers appeared in
               Germany, Hungary and Spain, different from indigenous
               hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive
               population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a
               $\sim{}$24,000-year-old Siberian. By $\sim{}$6,000-5,000 years
               ago, farmers throughout much of Europe had more hunter-gatherer
               ancestry than their predecessors, but in Russia, the Yamnaya
               steppe herders of this time were descended not only from the
               preceding eastern European hunter-gatherers, but also from a
               population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe
               came into contact $\sim{}$4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic
               Corded Ware people from Germany traced $\sim{}$75\% of their
               ancestry to the Yamnaya, documenting a massive migration into the
               heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery. This steppe
               ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans until at
               least $\sim{}$3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day
               Europeans. These results provide support for a steppe origin of
               at least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe.",

              date. This approach makes it economical to study ancient samples
              with low proportions of human DNA and increases the rate of
              conversion of sampled remains into interpretable data. So far,
              nearly all such data have been generated using a set of bait
              sequences targeting about 1.24 million SNPs (the ``1240k
              reagent''), but synthesis of the reagent has been cost-effective
              for only a few laboratories. In 2021, two companies, Daicel Arbor
              Biosciences and Twist Bioscience, made available assays that
              target the same core set of SNPs along with supplementary content.
              We test all three assays on a common set of 27 ancient DNA
              libraries and show that all three are effective at enriching many
              hundreds of thousands of SNPs. For all assays, one round of
              enrichment produces data that are as useful as two. In our
              testing, the ``Twist Ancient DNA'' assay produces the highest
              coverages, greatest uniformity on targeted positions, and almost
              no bias toward enriching one allele more than another relative to
              shotgun sequencing. We also identify hundreds of thousands of
              targeted SNPs for which there is minimal allelic bias when
              comparing 1240k data to either shotgun or Twist data. This
              facilitates coanalysis of the large data sets that have been
              generated using 1240k and Twist capture, as well as shotgun
              sequencing approaches.",
